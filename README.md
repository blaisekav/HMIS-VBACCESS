# HMIS-VBACCESS
This is a vb.net access software trial version for use in a hospital setting or pharmacy. The software can connect to mysql tables to improve data handling and storage capacity. However you will need my assistance to connect to mysql. The departments included in the software include: pharmacy, laboratory, xray, inventory, billing, accounts(paybill, invoice, assets, liabilities), reports(balancesheet,income statement, cash flow, trial balance) and administration(user rights, login data).
